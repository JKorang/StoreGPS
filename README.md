**BACKSTACK ISSUES**
        
        We currently have a lot of issues handling in the backstack.
        We need to re-evaluate this.  Currently, adding lists ruins the stack.
        This must be looked at near the end of development. 
        
        

 **4. Store Page**
 
        Need to set a store as Favorite (toggle button)
        Finish searching a store
        
        

 **5. Home Page**
 
        Currently only needs Nearby Stores to fill in information.
        
        
 
 **6. Store Cards**
 
        Add/Remove store as a favorite by long pressing card
        Requires having nearby stores working.
        
        
 **7. Settings Page**
 
        Determine what settings need to exist within the app (perhaps just theme selection)
        ****Still unsure of settings page, if anything besides wiping all databases?
        
        

 **10. App Logo/Name**
 
         Need a good sounding name for the application and an appicon.
         
         
 **11. Themeing**
 
         Currently using MaterialDark/MaterialLight.  
         Some variance is needed to give the application uniqueness.
         
         
 **12. Webpage**
 
         Still need access to the remote database to build stores/search items
