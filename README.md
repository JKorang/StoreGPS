**BACKSTACK ISSUES**
        
        We currently have a lot of issues handling in the backstack.
        We need to re-evaluate this.  Currently, adding lists ruins the stack.
        This must be looked at near the end of development. 

**ListAdapter.java**
        
        Case for foundItem:
        See TODO within the file, lines 144-147


 **1. List Page** 
 
        Need to handle sending an item to the found list.
        
        

 **2. Add New List**
 
        Edit RadioButtons to reflect colors/images (ONCE FINALIZED CHOICES MADE)
        
        

 **4. Store Page**
 
        Need to set a store as Favorite (toggle button)
        Finish searching a store
        
        

 **5. Home Page**
 
        Currently only needs Nearby Stores to fill in information.
        
        
 
 **6. Store Cards**
 
        Add/Remove store as a favorite by long pressing card
        Requires having nearby stores working.
        
        
 **7. Settings Page**
 
        Determine what settings need to exist within the app (perhaps just theme selection)
        ****Still unsure of settings page, if anything besides wiping all databases?
        
        
 **8. Help Page**
 
         Once design is nearing completion for this version, a help page needs to be written.
         Very simple and just plain text with images.
         
         
 **9. Iconography**
 
         Obtain a set of good icons for use within the app.
         Icons are needed for both navigation menu and the individual lists
         
         
 **10. App Logo/Name**
 
         Need a good sounding name for the application and an appicon.
         
         
 **11. Themeing**
 
         Currently using MaterialDark/MaterialLight.  
         Some variance is needed to give the application uniqueness.
         
         
 **12. Webpage**
 
         Still need access to the remote database to build stores/search items
         
         
         
 **13. Navigation Drawer**
 
         Navigation drawer currently highlights the item selected/chosen and maintains that state.
         That state must be either updated or the state memory removed from the drawer.
         Because we bounce between so many functions of the app so frequently, this is never consistent.
