# StoreGPS
Store GPS App for Senior Project

Work Remaining:

SQL Queries
    Some SQL commands are not yet written.  Need everything that works with a store locally on the device.
List Page 
    Show all items related to the list, as well as functionality of the list.
    Items have to be added, removed, marked found, and quantity controlled up and down.
My Stores
    Port code from MyList page.
Add New List
    Almost working. Creates a new list. (Runs SQL command)
Store Page
    Information view for a specific store.
    Should be name, logo, color, address, phone number, etc.
    Also has to have a set favorite store
Set Favorite Store
    Just an icon, maybe star, that fills when marked as a favorite.
    When marked as a favorite, added to My Stores (added to Stores SQL)
Home Page
    Once individual pages completed 100%, pull in portions of their code to generate home page.
    Home page is just a minimized mirror of the individual pages.
Card Menu Icon
    Drop down/dot menu for the cards to give quick add/remove functionality. 
Settings Page
    Determine what settings need to exist within the app (perhaps just theme selection)
Help Page
    Once design is nearing completion for this version, a help page needs to be written.
    Very simple and just plain text with images.
Iconography
    Obtain a set of good icons for use within the app.
    Icons are needed for both navigation menu and the individual lists
App Logo/Name
    Need a good sounding name for the application and an appicon.
Themeing
    Currently using MaterialDark/MaterialLight.  
    Some variance is needed to give the application uniqueness. 
Webpage
    Webpage development is needed yet.
    A store signs up and is able to edit its store info/profile (number, address etc.)
    Also need to store images (logo) to display on the application.
    Website database needs scripts/PHP for the application to obtain information about
      nearby stores and also for item search functionality.
